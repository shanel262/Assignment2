# Assignment 2
Assignment 2 for Distributed systems. A multi-threaded client/server app that allows users to pass in a radius and receive back the area of the circle. The users are authenticated using a database accessed using JDBC.

## To-Do
- Comment code
	- Client is done, needs proof reading
- Clean code
- Export as eclipse project

## How to run
First run the MultiThreadedServerA2 class and then the ClientA2 class. The user is first required to enter their account number (A/C number) and if it is authenticated then the user can enter a radius.
- __I have also created a Run class that starts the server and then the client.__

## Settings
The MultiThreadedServerA2 class contains three settings for connecting to the database:
- the url of the database
- the username (called user)
- and the password (called pass)
